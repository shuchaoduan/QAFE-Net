PFED5 is a Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) dataset for facial expression quality assessment. Videos were recorded using a single RGB camera from 41 PD patients performed five different facial expressions including sit at rest, smile, frown, squeeze eyes tightly, and clench teeth in clinical settings. The trained rater assigned a score for each expression, based on the protocols of MDS-UPDRS, varying between 0 and 4 depending on the level of severity. 

## Get Started
### Requirements
- pytroch >= 1.3.0
- tensorboardX
- cv2
- scipy
- einops 
- [torch_videovision](https://github.com/hassony2/torch_videovision)

### Data Preparation

-1: Download PFED5 dataset. To access the PFED5 dataset, please complete and sign the [PFED5 request form](dataset/PFED5_Request_Form.docx) and forward it to shuchao.duan@bristol.ac.uk. By submitting your application, you acknowledge and confirm that you have read and understood the relevant notice. Upon receiving your request, we will promptly respond with the necessary link and guidelines.

-2: We adopt SCRFD from [InsightFace](https://insightface.ai) for face detection and landmark estimation,
and [Albumentation library](https://albumentations.ai) for normalising the landmark positions to cropped face regions.

-3: Generate landmark heatmaps for corresponding video clips.

### Training on PFED5
run ```python main_PFED5.py --gpu 0,1 --batch_size 4 --epoch 100```

### Pretrained model weights
Dowonload pretrain weights (RGB encoder and heatmap encoder) from [here](https://github.com/shuchaoduan/QAFE-Net/models/pretrain). Put entire `pretrain` folder under `models` folder.

	```
	- models/pretrain/
		 FormerDFER-DFEWset1-model_best.pth
		 pose_only.pth
	```


### Evaluation Results
Will be updated...
